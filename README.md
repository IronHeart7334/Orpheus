# Orpheus

A video game designed to give me practice with Java.

## What I Learned

I've learned so much from doing this project, far more than what I would have just from watching tutorials:
* Basic Java class structures, such as:
  * Classes.
  * Abstract Classes.
  * Interfaces.
  * Enums.
* Swing classes to construct a GUI.
* IO to read and write files.
* Serializing objects in both JSON and the Serializable interface.
* Creating a peer-to-peer network using Sockets.
* Synchronizing data across the network using ObjectStream.
* Responding to key controls via key bindings.
* Preventing concurrent modification of objects in a multithreaded application using syncronization and locks.
* And so much more!
