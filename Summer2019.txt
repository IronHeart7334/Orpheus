Well, another programming season has come and gone. While I may still have a couple of weeks before I return to college, I've spent enough time on Orpheus this Summer: it's time to focus on other things.
In it's current state, the program works, multiplayer is just a little... iffy. Given that I knew next to nothing about socket programming when I began, and all the guides I've found have been rather basic, "iffy" is pretty good.
Am I happy with where Orpheus is? No. I'll never be happy with it, not until it's perfect, and trying to perfect it is a wormhole I don't want to get sucked into.
I'll probably work on it a bit more over the Summer (I really can't stop myself), but for now, I'll call it done.

With that said, their are many changes that I want to make next time I have a chance to work on this:
* Move to 3-D graphics?
* Change the game to a many vs users so that balancing isn't as much of a problem.
* Overall improvement to the actives / passives system so that it's easier to work with.
* Player controls...
* OrpheusScript
* Remove the ability to customize anything except Builds?
* Add Dataset class which contains all actives / passives / characterClasses / builds, so I don't have to use static methods to get by name
