It's time to focus on other things.
In it's current state, the program works, multiplayer is just a little... iffy. Given that I knew next to nothing about socket programming when I began, and all the guides I've found have been rather basic, "iffy" is pretty good.
Am I happy with where Orpheus is? No. I'll never be happy with it, not until it's perfect, and trying to perfect it is a wormhole I don't want to get sucked into.
I'll definitely work on it more (time permitting), but I'd like to make another Java game, one less chaotic and difficult to balance than this.

With that said, their are many changes that I want to make next time I have a chance to work on this:
* Move to 3-D graphics?
* Player controls...
* Plugin customization system instead of GUI (players create their own Java classes)
* redo multiplayer backend (how to launch a server?)
